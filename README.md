This is the code created by hiverize for smart beehives. It is also used within the Citizen Science Project Bee Observer. 

As we use different plattforms, such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone and Fipy (ESP32), there are different folders containing code and documentation for each. Please navigate in the folder of your choice and see a full documentation there.
